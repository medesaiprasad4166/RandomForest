# RandomForest

# PROJECT TITLE:

Classify the Random Forest Algoritham using skitlearn classifier"RandomForestClassifier"for "iris.csv" ,and predict the data how many species are interconnected with Nth DecisionTree Node

# TASKS:

1.import random forest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble library

2.Load your data using seaborn graphics library as an argument load_iris()

3.Pre-processes the data using skitlearn graphics library

4.Select the model using "model_selection" prompt sns as seaborn and sklearn as a machine learn library

5.Load iris.csv dataset for "data" as a input variable and "target" as a functionable output variable

6.Pick the train and test data using argumental library train_test_split

7.select the estimators as a Nth DecisionTree

8.Use a RandomForest classifier and fit your model

9.Findout your model Accuracy

# CONCLUSION:

My Model has apporoach 1.00 accuracy,which lies between in the range of 0-1 Hence it shows that RandomForest Decision model successfully implemented.
